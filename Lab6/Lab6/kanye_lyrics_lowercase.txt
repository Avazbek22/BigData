god is king we the soldiers
ultrabeam out the solar
when i get to heavens gates
i aint gotta peek over
keepin perfect composure
when i scream at the chauffeur
i aint mean im just focused
i aint mean im just focused
pour the lean out slower
got us clean out of soda
before the flood people judge
they did the same thing to noah
everybody wanted 
yandhi
then jesus christ did the laundry
they say the week start on monday
but the strong start on sunday
wont be in bondage to any man
john 833
we the descendants of abraham
ye should be made free
john 836
to whom the son set free is free indeed
he saved a wretch like me

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

father i stretch
stretch my hands to you

lifelike this is what your life like try to live your life right
people really know you push your buttons like typewrite
this is like a movie but its really very lifelike
every single night right every single fight right
i was looking at the gram and i dont even like likes
i was screamin at my dad he told me it aint christlike
i was screamin at the referee just like mike
lookin for a bright light sigel what your life like
riding on a white bike feeling like excitebike
 

stretch my hands to you

pressin on the gas supernova for a night light
screamin at my dad and he told me it aint christlike
but nobody never tell you when youre being like christ
only ever seein me only when they needin me
like if tyler perry made a movie for bet
searchin for a deity now you wanna see it free
now you wanna see if we lets just see if three apiece
tell me what your life like turn it down a bright light
drivin with my dad and he told me it aint christlike
 

stretch my hands to you

im just tryna find lve been lookin for a new way
im just really tryin not to really do the fool way
i dont have a cool way bein on my best though
block em on the text though nothin else next though
not another word letter picture or a decimal
 

father i stretch

wrestlin with god i dont really want to wrestle
man its really lifelike everything in my life
 

stretch my hands to you

arguing with my dad and he said it aint christlike

closed on sunday you my chickfila
youre my number one with the lemonade
raise our sons train them in the faith
through temptations make sure theyre wide awake
follow jesus listen and obey
no more livin for the culture we nobodys slave

stand up for my home
even if i take this walk alone
i bow down to the king upon the throne
my life is his im no longer my own
i pray to god that hell strengthen my hand
they will think twice steppin onto my land
i draw the line its written in the sand
try me and you will see that i aint playin
now back up off my family move your hands
i got my weapons in the spirits land
i jezebel dont even stand a chance
jezebel dont even stand a chance

yo pierre yo pierre

how you get so much favor on your side
accept him as your lord and saviour i replied
thou shalt love thy neighbor not divide
ima ride thats on god
his light shine the brightest in the dark
single mothers know they got my heart
and all my brothers locked up on the yard
you can still be anything you wanna be
went from one in four to one in three
thirteenth amendment gotta end it thats on me
he the new commander and the chief
thats on keef thats on god
before the ranch i had horses in the garage
when the forbes cover was just a mirage
they had me chasin statues thats on pride
oh my god bust said thats on tribe
when i thought the book of job was a job
the devil had my soul i cant lie
life gon have some lows and some highs
before the grammys ever gave a nod
i wore my heart on my sleeve i couldnt hide
in 03 they told me not to drive
i bleached my hair for every time i couldve died
but i survived thats on god
ive been tellin yall since 05
the greatest artist restin or alive
thats on la reid thats on clive
thats no jive thats on god
off the 350s he supplied
the irs want they fifty plus our tithe
man thats over half of the pie
i felt dry thats on god
thats why i charge the prices that i charge
i cant be out here dancin with the stars
no i cannot let my family starve
i go hard thats on god

hands on yeah hands on

cut out all the lights he the light
got pulled over see the brights
what you doin on the street at night
wonder if theyre gonna read your rights
thirteenth amendment three strikes
made a left when i shouldve made a right
told god last time on life
told the devil that im going on a strike
told the devil when i see him on sight
ive been working for you my whole life
told the devil that im going on a strike
ive been working for you my whole life
nothing worse than a hypocrite
change he aint really different
he aint even try to get permission
ask for advice and they dissed him
said im finna do a gospel album
what have you been hearin from the christians
theyll be the first one to judge me
make it feel like nobody love me
theyll be the first one to judge me
feelin like nobody love me
told people god was my mission
what have you been hearin from the christians
theyll be the first one to judge me
make it feel like nobody love me
make you feel alone in the dark and youll never see the light
man youre never seein home and you never see the domes
i can feel it when i write point of livin in the right
if they only see the wrongs never listen to the songs
just to listen is a fight but you booked me for the fight
its so hard to get along if they only see the slight
from the love of religion
what have you been hearin from the christians
theyll be the first one to judge me
make it seem like nobody love me
im not tryna lead you to visas
but if i try to lead you to jesus
we get called halfway believers
only halfway read ephesians
only if they knew what i knew uh
i was never new til i knew of
true and living god yeshua
the true and living god
somebody pray for me
